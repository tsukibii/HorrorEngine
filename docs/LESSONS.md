# Lessons

What each bug that took more than one try taught us: the rule, then the story in a line. Add one before pushing
the fix.

## Carried over from the Godot project (Woohill)

- **Measure, don't guess:** a check that prints one `<NAME> ok` line beats any amount of reading code. Every
  system gets one, and `tools/check_all.py` runs them all.
- **Keep context small:** summaries and tails, not whole files and logs. Contact sheets, not frames.
- **Small steps, pushed:** the user changes course quickly, so every step should stand on its own.

## This project

- **A box of absolutely placed cards has no height of its own:** the branch map's cards sat in a zero-height box and
  the page took the clicks; size the box to the cards (the map does now).
- **Merge the other session's push before building on the same file:** the local session's `motion.py import` (one
  file) landed on main while this branch had its own (every shot-list name); both forms now live under one command.
- **Playwright's own Chromium can't decode H.264 or AAC:** the desk's take test read nothing from a MiniMax-style
  mp4 until it used a WebM copy. Test takes with WebM; your Chrome or Edge plays the real mp4s.
- **A running desk server keeps the old serve.py:** new routes 404 until it's restarted (find its PID in one
  command, kill it in the next, start it again).
- **A dev skip mustn't skip the thing being tested:** the desk's Esc skip jumped past timed choices, so the karma
  test saw none; it now jumps to the next event instead.
- **A room with no doorway in had its entrance shot from its middle, looking straight down:** the planner now stands
  at the level's start spot (or just inside the south wall), so a new game's template passes the shot check.
- **Blender joins bones when it reads an FBX, and a joined bone can't move:** the first round-trip check of a
  Kimodo FBX was off by the whole walk, because the hips' travel was dropped on Blender's re-import, not in the file.
  Disconnect the bones before measuring (Unreal has no such rule).
- **Kimodo's skin is bound in an A-pose; its motions rest in a T-pose:** the first SK_SOMA put the A-pose mesh on the
  T-pose skeleton (64 cm apart at the hands). Kimodo's own skinning with identity local rotations puts the mesh in
  the T-pose first (`retarget.py` TPOSE). Its `from_standard_tpose` is the other way (to the BONES-SEED rest).
- **A Blender FBX in metres can say UnitScaleFactor 100 even with "FBX All":** for Unreal's own kind (centimetre
  values, factor 1) keep the scene unit at 0.01 m, import the centimetre BVH at scale 1, and export with
  `FBX_SCALE_NONE`. Read the header to be sure (`fbx_unit_scale`).
- **Walls are centred on the room edge (0.1 m thick):** a prop against a wall sits d/2 + 0.05 m from the edge.
  The pilot's bookshelf was 2 cm into the study wall until level_check caught it.
- **The greedy playthrough walks from where the player is, not from the level's start:** the first version
  locked the player out after the front door slammed behind them.
- **A greedy check finds secrets every time:** sweep the paths twice, once missing every `secret` beat and once
  finding them all, or the endings that need a secret missed are never reached.
- **The player keeps playing at an act choice:** use the key, read the note. The first check stopped the player at
  the choice with the key in hand and the door still locked, so only "hide" was possible.
- **Never kill by a pattern that the same command line contains:** `pkill -f`/`pgrep -f` match your own shell
  when the pattern (or the command that started the server) is in it. It happened twice. Start a server in one
  command, note its PID (`ps aux | grep "[s]erve.py"` in a separate command), and `kill <pid>` in another.
- **Ids made per scene must say which scene:** two staged stand-ins both called `cast_mari` overwrote each other in
  the shot planner.
- **A thing made per clip needs the clip in its id:** two clips starting at the same mark gave their stand-ins the
  same id, and the moved one overwrote the other in the shot planner (the second time this lesson came up: ids
  derived from data must include every key that varies).
- **Measure shots where the actor is, not where they started:** blocking moves actors, so the planner follows each
  actor's `move` keys across clips and measures a moving clip halfway.
- **"Medium shot" names a body part, not a distance:** the framing check measures the part a shot is about (face,
  chest up, waist up) as a share of the frame. The pilot's "MS" at 3.2 m read as a wide shot until it was measured.
- **`--no-build-isolation` means every build backend is ours to install:** Kimodo's demo pulls NVIDIA's `viser` fork
  from git, which builds with hatchling; `setup.py kimodo --demo` failed until hatchling joined the build tools.
- **A patch meant for other machines needs `--src-prefix=a/ --dst-prefix=b/`:** this machine's git has
  `diff.mnemonicprefix`, which writes `i/` and `w/`, and the patch refresh's own parsing broke on it.
- **Kimodo's demo keeps its skeleton on the GPU:** tensors made to run its FK (the pose window's rest pose) must be
  created on `skeleton.neutral_joints.device`, or TorchScript refuses the indexing.
- **Measure a prompt before trusting it:** of 12 horror prompts, 4 didn't do what they said on the first wording
  (no crouch, no cower, no getting up, a fast retreat). Two were fixed by rewording; two can't be (crouch-walking,
  slowness), and those need a pose or a paced path. `tools/kimodo_presets.py check` is the measure.
- **A run of things that each "stop the last one" needs its own token:** the score room's audition plays every
  variation in turn, but a take ending by itself went through the same stop as the Stop button and ended the whole
  audition after one card. Ending a take (`endPlay`) and stopping what the user started (`stopAll`) are two calls.
- **A compressor and limiter on the music bus make every cue the same loudness:** a dread bed rendered as loud as
  the jump scare (both about -14 dB RMS). Cue levels go after the limiter (the master), never on the notes.
- **A server started from a script must not keep the script's output:** the launcher's page servers inherited its
  stdout, so anything reading the launcher's output (a pipe, a test) waited for the server to end. Windows gets its
  own console window; elsewhere the server's output goes to Saved/launch/<name>.log.
- **UnrealClaude's bridge lists only its simple tools:** taking the script tools out of `HIDDEN_TOOL_NAMES` made
  them "mega" tools, which aren't listed either (16 of 28 shown). `setup.py unrealclaude --show-scripts` now adds
  them to `SIMPLE_TOOL_NAMES`; after a router change, restart Claude Code so the bridge reloads.
- **Start the editor before Claude Code:** the bridge gives its tool list once, when Claude Code starts, and never
  says it changed; started before the editor, Claude saw only `unreal_status`. Check the editor runs *this*
  `.uproject` too (`pgrep -a UnrealEditor`): it once reopened a stray template and the bridge never came up.
- **Story ids are unique across the whole file, levels included:** the scene builder's layouts planned on their own
  but failed beside an existing level (two `start`s, two `front_door`s). Anything added to a story is renamed
  against `takenIds()` first.
- **`node --check file.js` passes an ES module with a syntax error:** it reads the file as CommonJS and said nothing
  about a `const` declared twice, which then stopped the whole desk from loading. Check the desk's modules with
  `node --input-type=module --check < tools/director/<file>.js`.
- **A BroadcastChannel never crosses browser contexts:** Playwright's `browser.newPage()` makes a new context per
  page, so a test of the builder telling the desk it saved has to open both pages from one `newContext()`.
- **A level check that reads every level's rooms has to keep to the level it checks:** the doorway clearances of
  one level were tested against another level's furniture standing in the same place, and failed a borrowed level.
- **The desk's server imports storykit once:** after changing `plan.py`, `level_check.py` or anything it imports,
  restart `serve.py` (find its PID, kill it, start it again), or the pages plan with the old code. The kit's pieces
  were missing from the builder's 3D view, and a level check failed on a rule already fixed, both for this reason.
- **Unreal mustn't watch `Content/` for new files:** the merge put `Kit/presets.json` there, Unreal offered to import
  it as a DataTable, and the options dialog opened blank on another workspace and held the editor (and every MCP
  call) in its modal loop. `bMonitorContentDirectories=False` (setup.py configure), and a Hyprland rule keeps all of
  Unreal's windows on its workspace (4).
- **The `.uproject` must be Unreal's first argument:** `ue` put its `-ini:` flag first, and Unreal opened the Project
  Browser instead of the project (that's how a stray template got opened). The launcher now puts a `.uproject` first.
- **A script that opens a map crashed UnrealClaude:** it counted the actors afterwards in the world from before the
  script, which the new map had freed (SIGSEGV). Fixed in `ScriptExecutionManager.cpp`, kept in
  `setup/unrealclaude_linux.patch`.
- **`-ExecutePythonScript=` on the editor runs before the project's Python is on the path, and quits the editor
  after.** The desk's Generate leaves `Saved/Story/<G>/generate/pending` instead, and `init_unreal.py` runs it once
  the editor has loaded.
- **The editor saves its per-user settings over the project's defaults:** `bMonitorContentDirectories=False` in
  `DefaultEditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini` did nothing while `Saved/Config/LinuxEditor/` said True. Those settings
  aren't visible to Python either; `init_unreal.py` corrects the saved file.
- **A Slate tick isn't an engine frame:** with the editor in the background Slate ticks many times per frame, so
  `shots.take` queued all 18 cameras inside one frame and one picture came out. Wait on
  `SystemLibrary.get_frame_count()` for anything that needs the renderer.
- **Unreal's glTF import scales a skinned mesh's bones by their nodes but not its vertices:** MHR binds in
  centimetres under a 0.0098 node scale, so Mari came in as a 172 m skin on a 1.6 m skeleton and drew nowhere near
  her bones. The desk now exports a fresh skeleton with no scales, vertices and bones in metres, the mesh at the
  identity. Check an imported body's reference bones against its bounds before posing it.
- **The editor keeps a Python module it has imported:** `storykit.generate` reloaded the rest of storykit but not
  itself, so a Generate ran yesterday's code. The desk's script reloads it first.
- **FBXLoader's vertices aren't shared:** normals recomputed on them come out flat (a faceted body in Unreal). Keep
  the file's normals.
- **The desk lights every room with an ambient; Unreal's sky light doesn't get through Lumen's walls:** a room with
  no lamp (the Pilot's cellar stairs) played black in Unreal while the desk showed it. Each room gets a shadowless
  fill (`importer.room_fills`). And anything the desk lets the player do during a scene (look round the cone) has to
  be in the bake, or Unreal locks it.
- **The desk's server sends only the file types it lists** (`serve.py` STATIC): Play's CSS came back 404 until `.css`
  was added. A new kind of file in `tools/director/` needs its type there. A test can run its own desk beside the
  open one: `DESK_PORT=8781 python tools/director/serve.py`.
- **Mesh to MetaHuman needs a head, not a face:** the face-only mesh from `face_mesh.py` (MediaPipe's 468 points)
  traced badly: with no skull or ears the tracker struggled to place things, and MediaPipe's eye openings are too
  soft to read as eyelids. Bend a whole head template to the points instead (the template's own eyelids, shaped by
  the photo's), best the MetaHuman base head itself, so the result is already lined up.
- **Every stitched edge needs the same number of points on both sides:** `garment.py` sampled a straight edge as one
  point and a curve as twelve, so the drape skipped every straight-to-curved stitch (the skirt's waistband floated,
  the t-shirt slid off its shoulders). Straight edges now get twelve too. And GarmentCode's flat placement, 30 cm in
  front and 25 cm behind, sews shoulder seams straight through the shoulders: lay the panels on the body first.
- **To open MHR's sealed shell, move points, don't hide triangles:** hiding the triangles inside the lid outline
  left slivers over one eye (MHR's triangulation differs round each eye); sinking every point inside the outline
  behind the eyeball works whatever the triangles are. The mouth is still open: its visible inside isn't within the
  inner-lip outline at all, so the same trick showed a pale wall (a look at MHR's mouth geometry comes first).

**Sewing springs: gentle, not strong (2026-10-21).** Blender's `sewing_force_max` at 30 closed a GarmentCode t-shirt's
10 cm seam gaps so hard that it pulled the shirt off the shoulders and crushed the sleeves into rolls up the arms;
heavier or lighter fabric and stiffer bending didn't help. At 8 the seams still close (0.5 mm), the shirt stays on the
shoulders with real short sleeves, and skirts and pants drape as before. Try `DRAPE_SET='{"key": value}'` on a few
settings side by side (renders stacked) before rewriting the drape.
